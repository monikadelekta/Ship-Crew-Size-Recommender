# Ship-Crew-Size-Recommender

Based on the article written on Medium - (Non-Trivial Data Science Projects)[https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/non-trivial-data-science-projects-693edfe146d]. This is the triial example.

The aim is to build a regressor that recommends the “crew” size for potential ship buyers.

The goals are as follows:

1. Read the file and display columns.
2. Calculate basic statistics of the data (count, mean, std, etc) and examine data and state your observations.
3. Select columns that will be probably important to predict “crew” size.
4. If you removed columns explain why you removed those.
5. Use one-hot encoding for categorical features.
6. Create training and testing sets (use 60% of the data for the training and reminder for testing).
7. Build a machine learning model to predict the ‘crew’ size.
8. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set and testing data sets.
